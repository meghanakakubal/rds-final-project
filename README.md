# rds-final-project
In this capstone project for my Responsible Data Science project, we evaluated the performance of a real-world automated decision system (ADS). Through data cleaning, distribution analysis, performance metrics, and comparisons we determined how the model resulted in disparate impact for marginalized populations.

This project was formally described as creating a 'nutritional' label for an ADS. An example of a similar project is ProPublica's piece on [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). 

Our full project write-up, with descriptions and visualizations, can be found [here] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVlLDblEw9kNJnsDPA6UoupriWRhoKS6/view?usp=sharing)
